## Aswan

Come with me on this doomed escape
The dance whose steps reverse primal currents

Let's go down south of Aswan
Where the hourglass turns
And swim upstream to the heart
Of twin mysteries, blue and white,
Past the elephantine corridor nilometer
Past the lost ruins of the Aswan well
Whose sleeping eye marked divine boundaries
Whose spirit haunts an imaginary line
Yearning to return to a caved-in home
Lost beyond the reach of memory
Let's get lost at the end of the world
Only the lost know it when they see it

The first time you blew out a dandelion
Did you think you could take it back?

## Untitled

Who am I to understand
Ever unmoved by envelopes
What this one could mean to you
You may know what's inside
Or it's a total surprise
I'll measure by the lights in your eyes
You'll cast lines in the sea to ponder
I'll gather shells on the shore in wonder
Slender shafts of sunset gently pierce
Your impeccably practiced disguise
It seems you couldn't have it otherwise

## Waves

The waves tell the shore
Let me try again

And the shore waits
Listening to the loving sounds
Traced on her open palm
In papillary lines

The sound of one wing
Beating on a misty wind
The whisper of a steady hand
Smoothing skirts of golden sand

Waves bear gifts to the shore
Who picks them up and says no more
Waves boil and rage in war
Stern beaches echo back their roar

I'll try again, sigh sun-bright sheets
Melting away beneath our feet
